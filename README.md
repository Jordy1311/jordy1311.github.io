# This is my portfolio

It's your standard portfolio but is aiming to be as small as possible.

It's a portfolio after all. I wanted it to accomplish the job, look okay and not add to the bloat of the internet.

## It...
- doesn't have **any** javascript
- has css in the html header to reduce files transferred
- uses browser safe font-families to save sending one (or many ðŸ™ƒ)
- uses compressed images that still look okay
