# This is my portfolio

It's your standard portfolio but is aiming to be as small as possible.

It's a portfolio after all. I want it to accomplish it's job, look okay and not add to the bloat of the internet.

At the moment you can find it here: [http://jordy1311.web.app/](https://jordy1311.github.io)

## It...
- doesn't have **any** javascript
- has css in the html header to reduce files transferred
- uses browser safe font-families to save sending one (or many ðŸ™ƒ)
- uses compressed images that still look okay
